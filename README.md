Project Description:
This project is an interactive Streamlit-based web application designed to help real estate analysts, potential renters, and investors gain valuable insights into the rental market. By leveraging time series analysis and forecasting models, the application enables users to explore historical trends and predict future rent prices, aiding in data-driven decision-making.

How It Works:
Users can upload the Melted_dataframe.csv file (available in the repositoryâ€™s Data folder) into the application. The app then performs the following key tasks:

Data Exploration & Visualization:

Displays historical rent price trends through interactive visualizations using plotly.
Highlights seasonal patterns and market fluctuations.
Time Series Forecasting & Statistical Analysis:

Implements advanced forecasting models like ARIMA, SARIMAX, and Facebook Prophet to predict future rent prices.
Conducts stationarity tests (ADF Test) to assess data suitability for time series modeling.
Provides Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation plots (ACF & PACF) to understand dependencies in rent pricing over time.
Decision-Making Support:

For Real Estate Analysts & Investors: Helps in identifying rental price trends, understanding market volatility, and optimizing investment strategies.
For Renters: Allows potential tenants to anticipate rental price movements, assisting them in choosing the best time to rent or relocate.
This tool empowers stakeholders with data-driven insights, enhancing their ability to forecast rental costs, detect pricing anomalies, and make informed financial decisions in an ever-changing real estate market.
